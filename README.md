# Progressive Meshes

This project is an implementation of the Hugues Hoppe's seminal 1996 paper _Progressive Meshes_. In addition, I have implemented Michael Garland & Paul S. Heckbert's 1997 paper _Surface Simplification Using Quadric Error Metrics_ to yield more high-quality mesh decimation.

## Building
All dependencies are included as submodules in the repo. Only CMake, OpenGL, and a C++11 compatible compiler are needed.

## Running
Run the executable `bin/ProgressiveMeshes` from the project root.

See my [blog](https://www.theseventhline.net/2018/05/progressive-meshes/) for detailed explanation.
