# Progressive Meshes

This project is an implementation of the Hugues Hoppe's seminal 1996 paper __Progressive Meshes__. In addition, I have implemented Michael Garland & Paul S. Heckbert's 1997 paper __Surface Simplification Using Quadric Error Metrics__ to yield more high-quality mesh decimation.

## Building
All dependencies are included as submodules in the repo. Only CMake, OpenGL, and a C++11 compatible compiler are needed.

## Running
Run the executable `bin/ProgressiveMeshes` from the project root.
